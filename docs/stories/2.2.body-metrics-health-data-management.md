# Story 2.2: Body Metrics and Health Data Management

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** fitness tracking application,
**I want** comprehensive body metrics and health data management APIs,
**so that** I can store, track, and analyze user health information with proper privacy controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User Body metrics endpoint (`GET/PUT /api/users/body-metrics`) managing weight, height, BMI, and body composition data
2. Health metrics tracking with historical data storage and trend analysis capabilities
3. User profile management including activity level, goals, and health conditions
4. Current macros calculation and storage based on user goals and body composition

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From Story 2.1: User registration and account management APIs successfully implemented with comprehensive profile data validation
- User model structure established with embedded body composition metrics
- JWT authentication and admin role validation patterns established
- Input validation and sanitization middleware working correctly with nested objects
- Comprehensive test coverage patterns established with Jest and Supertest

### Data Models
User model body composition structure [Source: architecture/data-models.md#users-collection]:
- Body composition metrics embedded in user document for frequent access
- Body age, fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage
- Rohrer index, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral fat measurements
- Body water metrics: extracellular water, body cell mass, ratios
- Basal metabolic rate, protein, and mineral content
- All metrics stored as numbers with appropriate units

Historical data storage pattern [Source: architecture/data-models.md#key-mongodb-design-decisions]:
- Time-series pattern for daily user activity tracking
- Embedding for frequent reads (body composition metrics)
- Single document reads for complete user profiles

### API Specifications
Body metrics endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- GET /api/users/body-metrics - Retrieve current body metrics
- PUT /api/users/body-metrics - Update body metrics with validation
- GET /api/users/body-metrics/history - Retrieve historical metrics with filtering
- GET /api/analytics/body/* - Body composition trend analysis (future story)

### Component Specifications
No specific UI component requirements as this is backend-only story.

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Controllers: src/controllers/users.controller.ts (extend existing)
- Models: src/models/User.ts (extend existing with body metrics history)
- Routes: src/routes/users.routes.ts (extend existing)
- Validation: src/utils/validation.ts (extend existing schemas)
- Services: src/services/users.service.ts (extend existing for body metrics logic)
- Tests: tests/unit/controllers/users.controller.test.ts and tests/integration/api/users.test.ts

### Testing Requirements
Test strategy requirements [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- Unit tests: 85% minimum coverage for service layer, 75% for controllers
- Jest framework with TypeScript support
- File convention: *.test.ts co-located with source files
- Integration tests in tests/integration/ with real database connections
- Mock external dependencies including databases and external APIs
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure
- Cover edge cases and error conditions with specific test scenarios

### Technical Constraints
Technology stack requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- MongoDB 7.0 with Mongoose 8.0.3 for data persistence
- TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode compilation
- Express.js 4.18.2 for route handling
- Joi 17.11.0 for input validation
- Winston 3.11.0 for structured logging

Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Async/await only - never use callbacks or raw Promises
- Input validation required - all endpoints must use Joi validation
- Error logging mandatory - all catch blocks must log with Winston
- JWT validation required for protected routes
- Database transactions for multi-document operations
- TypeScript strict mode with no any types allowed

Security requirements [Source: architecture/security.md]:
- PII Handling: Field-level encryption for sensitive health data
- Role-based access controls for health data endpoints
- Audit logging for health data access and modifications
