# Story 4.3: Meal Detection Service Integration

## Status
✅ Completed

## Story

**As a** meal tracking system,
**I want** reliable integration with external meal detection service with meal history and correction capabilities,
**so that** I can process meal images, store scan history with pictures, and allow users to reuse or correct previous meal detections.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Meal Upload with Storage**: Endpoint (`POST /api/nutrition/upload-meal`) processing images through external service and storing both the image and detected nutrition data
2. **Meal History Retrieval**: Endpoint (`GET /api/nutrition/meal-history`) returning user's previous meal scans with images and nutrition data for reuse
3. **Meal Reuse**: Endpoint (`POST /api/nutrition/log-previous-meal`) allowing users to log a meal from their history without re-scanning
4. **Meal Correction**: Endpoint (`POST /api/nutrition/correct-meal`) accepting user corrections for a specific meal and triggering re-analysis of that meal only
5. **Meal Re-analysis**: System capability to re-analyze specific meals based on user corrections and update only that meal's macro data
6. **External Service Integration**: Error handling with retry logic and fallback to manual meal entry options
7. **Service Rate Limiting**: Request optimization to manage external API costs and usage quotas
