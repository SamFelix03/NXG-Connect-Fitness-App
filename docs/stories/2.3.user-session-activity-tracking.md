- Jest framework with TypeScript support
- File convention: *.test.ts co-located with source files
- Integration tests in tests/integration/ with real database connections
- Mock external dependencies including push notification services

- Cover edge cases and error conditions with specific test scenarios

### Technical Constraints
Technology stack requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- MongoDB 7.0 with Mongoose 8.0.3 for data persistence
- TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode compilation
- Express.js 4.18.2 for route handling

- Winston 3.11.0 for structured logging
- Redis 7.2 for session management and caching

Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Async/await only - never use callbacks or raw Promises
- Input validation required - all endpoints must use Joi validation
- Error logging mandatory - all catch blocks must log with Winston
- JWT validation required for protected routes
- Database transactions for multi-document operations
- TypeScript strict mode with no any types allowed

Security requirements [Source: architecture/security.md]:
- Session token security with JWT-based authentication
- Device token encryption and secure storage
- User activity data privacy protection
- Feedback content moderation and spam detection
- Rate limiting for analytics and feedback endpoints

Analytics requirements:
- Real-time event tracking with minimal performance impact
- Data aggregation with efficient MongoDB queries
- Privacy-compliant analytics without PII exposure
- Retention policy for analytics data (90 days default)
- GDPR-compliant data export for user analytics
