# Story 4.1: Workout Planning Service Integration APIs

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** workout management system,
**I want** seamless integration with external workout planning service that creates and manages single active workout plans per user,
**so that** I can retrieve personalized workout plans, associate them with users through activePlans records, and ensure each user has exactly one modifiable workout plan.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Single Workout Plan Creation**: Endpoint (`POST /api/integrations/workout-plans`) that creates one workout plan per user via external service and updates user's `activePlans.workoutPlanId` with the new plan ID
2. **Single Plan Enforcement**: System ensures each user has exactly one active workout plan by deactivating previous plans before creating new ones
3. **Workout Plan Caching**: Store received plans in MongoDB with user association through `activePlans` record, including expiration and refresh mechanisms
4. **Daily Workout Access**: Endpoint (`GET /api/workouts/daily`) returning user's single active workout plan with real-time machine availability integration
5. **Workout Library**: Endpoint (`GET /api/workouts/library`) aggregating external service data with local customization options
6. **External Service Integration**: Error handling with circuit breaker pattern and fallback to user's cached active workout plan
7. **Plan Refresh Management**: Automated refresh mechanism that regenerates workout plans every 2 weeks based on current user parameters, maintaining single active plan per user
8. **Data Validation**: Service response validation ensuring workout data integrity before storage and user association
9. **Automated Plan Management**: Fully automated workout plan creation and storage without user modification capabilities
10. **Active Plans Maintenance**: Proper management of user's `activePlans.workoutPlanId` reference with cleanup of inactive plans

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 (Access Control Fixes):
- Authentication middleware patterns established with `requireUserOrAdmin()` and `isUserAdmin()` helpers
- Dual access patterns (user/admin) successfully implemented for user data access
- JWT validation patterns and error response formats are standardized
- Ownership validation patterns available for user-specific resources

### Data Models
**workoutPlans Collection** [Source: database-schema.md#workoutPlans]:
- Structure: `{ userId, planName, isActive, workoutDays: [{ muscleGroup, categories: [{ exercises }] }] }`
- Relationships: Referenced by users.activePlans.workoutPlanId
- Indexes: `userId + isActive` for efficient user plan queries

**users Collection Extensions** [Source: data-models.md#users]:
- `fitnessProfile`: `{ level, goal, healthConditions }` - Required for external service API calls
- `demographics`: `{ age, heightCm, weightKg, activityLevel }` - User profile data for personalized plans
- `activePlans.workoutPlanId` - References current workout plan

**branches Collection for Machine Availability** [Source: data-models.md#branches]:
- `machines` array with `isAvailable` field for real-time availability
- Machine metadata: `{ name, type, location, qrCode, isAvailable }`

### API Specifications
**External Workout Planning Service** [Source: external-apis.md#workout-planning-service-api]:
- Base URL: `https://mock.workout-service.com/v1`
- USE A MOCK URL THAT RESPONDS WITH a compatible response format to fill all the fields in the workout and workout plan db for now.
- basically, a response that fills the workoutPlans collection and workouts collection with mock data.
- we will implement the real endpoint later.
- keep this mock service very simple for now.


### Component Specifications
**Service Layer** [Source: source-tree.md#services]:
- Location: `src/services/external/workout-planning.service.ts`

## QA Results

### Live Testing Results (2025-07-28)

**Complete User Flow Testing**: ✅ **PASSED**

**Test Scenario**: Admin creates workout plan for member user, member fetches muscle group workout

**Test Steps Executed**:
1. **User Registration**: 
   - Admin user: `admin2@example.com` ✅
   - Member user: `member1@example.com` ✅

2. **Profile Completion**: 
   - Admin completes member's fitness profile (level: intermediate, goal: muscle_building) ✅
   - Admin completes member's body metrics (age: 25, height: 175cm, weight: 75kg, gender: Male) ✅

3. **Cross-User Workout Plan Creation**:
   - Admin creates workout plan for member using `POST /api/integrations/workout-plans` ✅
   - Request: `{"targetUserId": "6887c25a2babf685b8fe96cc", "forceRefresh": true}` ✅
   - Response: Plan created successfully with planId: "mock-plan-12345" ✅

4. **Member Workout Access**:
   - Member fetches "Push" workout using `GET /api/workouts/days/push` ✅
   - Response includes 3 exercises: Bench Press, Overhead Press, Tricep Dips ✅
   - Muscle group structure: Push/Pull/Legs (not Chest/Back/etc) ✅

**Key Technical Fixes Applied**:
1. **Admin Role Detection**: Fixed integrations controller to use same admin logic as auth middleware (email contains 'admin') ✅
2. **Database Schema**: Added required `nextRefreshDate` and `cacheExpiry` fields to WorkoutPlan model ✅  
3. **Route Authorization**: Removed unnecessary ownership check from workout routes for own-data access ✅
4. **JSON Parsing**: Fixed shell escaping issues in curl commands causing "Bad escaped character" errors ✅

**API Response Validation**:
- Workout plan creation returns proper metadata and timestamps ✅
- Member workout fetch returns expected structure with exercise details ✅
- Machine availability properly set to null when no branchId provided ✅
- Error handling works correctly for invalid muscle groups ✅

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Admin can create workout plans for other users via `targetUserId` parameter ✅
- Member users can access their own workout data ✅
- Token expiration handled properly ✅
- Cross-user authorization properly enforced ✅

**Final Verification**: The complete user journey works end-to-end with proper admin-to-member workflow, demonstrating that admins can successfully generate workout plans for gym members who can then access their personalized workouts.
