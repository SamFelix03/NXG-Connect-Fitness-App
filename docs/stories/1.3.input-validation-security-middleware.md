# Story 1.3: Input Validation and Security Middleware

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** backend API,
**I want** comprehensive input validation and security protection,
**so that** I can prevent injection attacks, validate all incoming data, and maintain secure operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Joi validation schemas implemented for all API endpoints with detailed error messages
2. Express-validator middleware for request sanitization and XSS prevention
3. MongoDB injection prevention through query sanitization and parameterized queries
4. CORS configuration allowing only authorized origins with proper preflight handling
5. Request size limiting middleware preventing oversized payload attacks
6. API versioning support with proper header handling and backward compatibility
7. Security headers middleware (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) configured via Helmet.js
8. Audit logging middleware tracking all authentication events and sensitive operations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- JWT authentication system is fully implemented with User model, JWT utilities, authentication service, and middleware
- Redis integration working for session management and rate limiting
- Authentication endpoints (register, login, refresh, logout) are operational and tested
- Rate limiting middleware already implemented with express-rate-limit and Redis store
- Winston logging configuration established and working
- [Source: Previous Story 1.2 completion notes]

### Data Models
- User model exists with authentication fields and basic validation [Source: Previous Story 1.2]
- User schema includes: email (unique), username, password (hashed), profile fields
- Authentication-specific fields: refreshTokens array, emailVerified boolean
- Password validation: minimum 8 characters, special characters, numbers required
- [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]

### API Specifications
- Authentication endpoints already implemented: POST /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/refresh, /api/auth/logout
- Health check endpoint: GET /health returns database and service status
- All API endpoints must use /api/ prefix for versioning support
- JSON request/response format with consistent error structure
- [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]

### Component Specifications
- Validation middleware must be applied before business logic processing per security requirements
- Express-validator integration required for sanitization alongside existing Joi validation
- Helmet.js already specified in tech stack (version 7.1.0) for security headers
- CORS must support credentials for JWT authentication flows
- [Source: architecture/security.md#input-validation, architecture/security.md#api-security]

### File Locations
Based on project structure, create files in:
- src/middleware/validation.middleware.ts (new validation wrapper)
- src/middleware/sanitization.middleware.ts (new XSS prevention)
- src/middleware/audit.middleware.ts (new audit logging)
- src/utils/validation.ts (extend existing with comprehensive schemas)
- src/app.ts (update with new middleware integration)
- Update src/routes/auth.routes.ts with new validation middleware
- [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests co-located with source files using Jest 29.7.0
- 85% minimum coverage for middleware and validation functions
- Integration tests in tests/integration/ for security middleware effectiveness
- Mock external dependencies using Jest built-in mocking
- Test edge cases and error conditions with specific test scenarios
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure
- Security tests must verify injection prevention and XSS protection
- [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

### Technical Constraints
- Use exact versions from tech stack: Joi 17.11.0, express-rate-limit 7.1.5, helmet 7.1.0
- All middleware must be TypeScript strict mode compatible
- Input validation required for all API endpoints per coding standards
- Error logging mandatory in all catch blocks using Winston logger
- No any types allowed - maintain strict TypeScript compliance
- Follow async/await pattern exclusively for error handling
- [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Error Handling Patterns
- Use structured error responses with consistent format across endpoints
- Custom error classes: ValidationError, AuthenticationError, AuthorizationError
- Centralized error handling middleware for HTTP status codes
- JSON structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracking
- Sanitized error messages without internal details for user-facing errors
- [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#general-approach, #business-logic-errors]

### Security Implementation Requirements
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP using express-rate-limit with Redis
- CORS with strict origin validation and credentials support
- Security headers: CSP, HSTS, XSS protection via Helmet.js
- TLS 1.3 minimum with HTTPS enforcement
- No PII, passwords, or tokens in application logs
- Field-level validation with whitelist approach preferred over blacklist
- [Source: architecture/security.md#api-security, #data-protection]

### Testing
- Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support for unit testing
- Supertest 6.3.3 for HTTP endpoint integration testing
- Test files co-located with source: *.test.ts adjacent to implementation
- 85% minimum coverage for middleware functions
- Security-specific tests for injection prevention and XSS protection
- Mock external dependencies and databases for unit tests
- Integration tests with real MongoDB and Redis connections in tests/integration/
- [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
