# Story 5.1: Workout Progress Analytics Engine

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** fitness analytics system,
**I want** comprehensive workout progress calculation and tracking APIs,
**so that** I can provide detailed performance metrics, trends, and goal achievement insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Daily workout analytics endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/workout/daily`) calculating completion percentages, consistency scores, and performance metrics
2. Weekly workout progress endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/workout/weekly`) aggregating strength gains, endurance improvements, and workout streaks
3. Workout history analytics (`GET /api/analytics/workout/history`) with filterable exercise logs and performance trend calculations
4. Goal tracking endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/goals/workout`) monitoring progress toward strength, endurance, and consistency targets
5. Performance comparison analytics providing anonymized benchmarking against similar user profiles
6. Workout streak calculation and milestone detection with achievement trigger integration
7. Auto-progression analytics suggesting weight increases and rep adjustments based on performance history
8. Exercise-specific analytics tracking personal records, volume progression, and technique improvements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist yet for Epic 5. This is the first analytics story and establishes the foundation for all subsequent analytics functionality.

### Data Models
**Key Collections for Analytics:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#data-models]
- **gymSessions:** Contains completed workout data with `actualWorkout.completedExercises` array including exercise performance metrics, weights used, sets, reps, and timing
- **userActivity:** Stores daily workout activity with `workoutActivity.workoutHistory` for exercise completion tracking and performance notes
- **users:** Contains user profile data including `fitnessProfile.goal` and `bodyComposition` for goal tracking and benchmarking
- **workoutPlans:** Referenced for planned vs actual workout comparisons and goal alignment
- **exercises:** Exercise library with `metadata.muscleGroups` for categorizing analytics

**Critical Data Structures:**
- `gymSessions.actualWorkout.completedExercises[]` - Exercise performance data including `weightUsed`, `sets`, `reps`, timing
- `userActivity.workoutActivity.completionPercentage` - Daily completion metrics
- `gymSessions.pointsEarned` and `achievementsUnlocked` - Gamification integration data

### API Specifications
**Analytics Endpoints Structure:** [Source: architecture/components.md#analytics-engine]
- All endpoints follow `/api/analytics/workout/*` pattern
- Must implement MongoDB aggregation pipelines for performance calculations
- Background aggregation jobs required for complex metrics
- Redis caching mandatory for frequently accessed analytics

**Authentication Requirements:** [Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service]
- All analytics endpoints must use JWT authentication middleware
- Protected routes require valid JWT tokens from Authorization header

### Component Specifications
**Analytics Engine Component:** [Source: architecture/components.md#analytics-engine]
- **Responsibility:** Calculate performance metrics, progress tracking, and goal achievement analytics  
- **Dependencies:** MongoDB aggregation pipelines, Redis (cached results), User activity data
- **Technology Stack:** MongoDB aggregation framework, Node.js scheduled jobs, Redis caching

### File Locations
**Source Tree Structure:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Controller:** `src/controllers/analytics.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers for analytics endpoints
- **Service:** `src/services/analytics.service.ts` - Business logic for analytics calculations
- **Routes:** `src/routes/analytics.routes.ts` - Express route definitions for analytics
- **Validation:** `src/utils/validation.ts` - Joi schemas for analytics input validation
- **Tests:** Co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` convention

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support
- **Coverage:** 85% minimum for service layer, 75% for controllers
- **File Convention:** `*.test.ts` co-located with source files
- **Integration Tests:** Use Supertest 6.3.3 for HTTP endpoint testing
- **Test Data:** Factory pattern for consistent test data generation in `tests/fixtures/`
- **Mocking:** Jest built-in mocking with manual mocks for external services

### Technical Constraints
**MongoDB Requirements:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Multi-document operations must use MongoDB transactions for consistency
- All aggregation queries must include proper indexing strategy
- Database queries must implement proper timeout handling

**Redis Caching:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- All Redis keys must use consistent prefixes: `analytics:workout:*` for organization
- Cache TTL must be appropriate for data freshness requirements

**Error Handling:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- All catch blocks must log errors with context using Winston logger
- External service timeouts mandatory for complex aggregation operations
- Async/await only - no callbacks or raw Promises

### Performance Considerations
**Database Indexing:** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#indexing-strategy]
```javascript
// Required indexes for analytics performance
db.gymSessions.createIndex({ "userId": 1, "checkInTime": -1 })
db.userActivity.createIndex({ "userId": 1, "date": -1 })
db.gymSessions.createIndex({ "userId": 1, "status": 1, "checkInTime": -1 })
```

**Caching Strategy:** [Source: architecture/components.md#analytics-engine]
- Cache daily analytics with 1-hour TTL
- Cache weekly progress with 24-hour TTL
- Implement cache invalidation on new workout completion

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
**Test Organization:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Unit tests must be co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` convention
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure
- Mock all external dependencies including databases and external APIs
- Cover edge cases and error conditions with specific test scenarios

**Integration Testing:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- Location: `tests/integration/api/` directory with organized test suites
