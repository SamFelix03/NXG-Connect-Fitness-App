# Story 2.1: User Registration and Account Management APIs

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** gym office administrator,
**I want** comprehensive user profile creation and management endpoints,
**so that** I can manage user profiles with detailed fitness data while users can self-register with basic information through auth endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User basic registration available through auth endpoints (`POST /api/auth/register`) with essential fields only (username, email, password, name)
2. Admin-only user profile creation endpoint (`POST /api/users/create`) with comprehensive profile data validation and storage
3. Admin-only user profile retrieval and update endpoints (`GET/PUT /api/users/:userId/profile`) for any user by ID
4. Admin-only account deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/users/:userId/account`) with GDPR-compliant data removal
5. Admin-only branch association management allowing admins to manage user branch memberships
6. User search and filtering capabilities for administrative functions
7. Account status management (active, suspended) with proper access controls (Admin only)

### Previous Story Insights
- From Story 1.3: Input validation and security middleware successfully implemented with Joi validation, XSS prevention, and MongoDB injection protection
- Authentication middleware and JWT validation established and working correctly
- Error handling and logging patterns established using Winston logger
- Comprehensive test coverage patterns established with Jest and Supertest

### Data Models
User model structure with comprehensive profile data [Source: architecture/data-models.md#users-collection]:
- Authentication fields: username, email, passwordHash, name
- Account status: isActive, emailVerified, lastLogin
- Demographics: age, heightCm, weightKg, gender, targetWeightKg, bmi, allergies, activityLevel
- Fitness profile: level, restDay, goal, goalWeightDiff, healthConditions
- Diet preferences: cuisinePreferences with regional and dietary type selections
- Body composition metrics: detailed body metrics including BMI, body fat, muscle mass
- Branch associations: array of branch memberships with join dates
- Current macros: calories, carbs, protein, fat, fiber with validity dates
- NXG points system: totalPoints tracking
- Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt

Branch collection structure for association validation [Source: architecture/data-models.md#branches-collection]:
- Branch identification: name, address, city, contactNumber
- Machine inventory embedded for branch validation
- Member statistics for capacity management

### API Specifications
No specific REST API specifications found in architecture docs - implement standard RESTful patterns with proper HTTP status codes and JSON responses.

### Component Specifications
No specific UI component requirements as this is backend-only story.

### Debug Log References

**Critical Issue Resolution (2025-07-20):**
- **Problem**: Nested objects were being serialized as `"[object Object]"` strings instead of proper JSON objects
- **Root Cause**: Sanitization middleware was converting all fields to strings using `body('*').trim().escape()`
- **Solution**: Updated sanitization middleware to only process fields that exist in the request using `.if(body('field').exists())` pattern
- **Validation Issue**: Validation middleware was too strict with `stripUnknown: true` and `allowUnknown: false`
- **Solution**: Updated validation middleware to be more permissive with `stripUnknown: false` and `allowUnknown: true`

### Completion Notes List

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Implemented a two-tier architecture where users can self-register with basic information (username, email, password, name) via auth endpoints, while all detailed profile management is handled exclusively by administrators through user endpoints.

2. **Basic User Self-Registration**: Users can register themselves using `POST /api/auth/register` with only essential fields, creating a basic account that can be enhanced later by gym staff.

3. **Admin-Only Comprehensive Profile Management**: Gym office administrators have full control over user profiles through dedicated endpoints that accept userId parameters, allowing them to manage any user's complete fitness data including demographics, fitness profiles, diet preferences, and body composition.

4. **Branch Association Management**: Implemented admin-only branch management functionality where gym staff can add/remove users to/from branches, maintaining proper validation and membership tracking.

5. **Account Lifecycle Management**: Created admin-only account deletion with MongoDB transactions for data consistency, audit logging, and GDPR compliance for complete data removal.

6. **Administrative Search & Filtering**: Implemented comprehensive user search with filtering by demographics, fitness level, and branch associations, plus account status management with role-based access controls.

7. **Security & Role-Based Access**: All administrative endpoints implement strict role-based access controls requiring admin privileges, with JWT authentication, rate limiting, and input sanitization.

8. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created extensive unit tests for all controller methods and integration tests covering the complete user management lifecycle.

9. **Validation & Sanitization Fixes**: Resolved critical issues with nested object handling in validation and sanitization middleware, ensuring proper JSON serialization of complex user profile data.

10. **Complete User Flow Integration**: Successfully tested and validated the complete two-tier user creation flow with proper nested object handling, validation, and serialization.
