# Epic 5: Analytics & Progress Tracking APIs

**Epic Goal**: Develop comprehensive analytics and progress tracking APIs that aggregate user data, calculate performance metrics, and provide detailed insights for workout, nutrition, and body composition progress.

## Story 5.1: Workout Progress Analytics Engine

As a **fitness analytics system**,
I want **comprehensive workout progress calculation and tracking APIs**,
so that **I can provide detailed performance metrics, trends, and goal achievement insights**.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Daily workout analytics endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/workout/daily`) calculating completion percentages, consistency scores, and performance metrics
2. Weekly workout progress endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/workout/weekly`) aggregating strength gains, endurance improvements, and workout streaks
3. Workout history analytics (`GET /api/analytics/workout/history`) with filterable exercise logs and performance trend calculations
4. Goal tracking endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/goals/workout`) monitoring progress toward strength, endurance, and consistency targets
5. Performance comparison analytics providing anonymized benchmarking against similar user profiles
6. Workout streak calculation and milestone detection with achievement trigger integration
7. Auto-progression analytics suggesting weight increases and rep adjustments based on performance history
8. Exercise-specific analytics tracking personal records, volume progression, and technique improvements

## Story 5.2: Nutrition Analytics and Macro Tracking

As a **nutrition analytics system**,
I want **detailed nutrition progress tracking and macro analysis APIs**,
so that **I can monitor dietary compliance, calculate nutrition metrics, and provide meal optimization insights**.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Daily nutrition analytics endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/nutrition/daily`) calculating macro adherence, calorie balance, and meal timing compliance
2. Nutrition progress tracking (`GET /api/analytics/nutrition/progress`) showing trends in macro distribution and dietary goal achievement
3. Meal compliance analytics endpoint calculating adherence rates to meal plans and nutrition targets
4. Macro optimization suggestions based on workout performance and body composition goals
