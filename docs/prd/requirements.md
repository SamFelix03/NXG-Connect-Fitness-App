# Requirements

## Functional

1. **FR1**: The backend shall implement JWT-based authentication API with 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens, and secure session management using Redis
2. **FR2**: The backend shall provide NFC/QR-based gym session management APIs for starting/ending sessions with automatic timeout and branch validation
3. **FR3**: The backend shall maintain real-time machine availability tracking with WebSocket support and machine linking/unlinking endpoints
4. **FR4**: The backend shall integrate with external workout planning service API, cache workout plans in MongoDB, and provide workout execution tracking endpoints
5. **FR5**: The backend shall integrate with external meal detection and meal planning service APIs, storing nutrition data and providing macro tracking endpoints
6. **FR6**: The backend shall implement comprehensive analytics APIs calculating workout/nutrition progress with aggregated performance metrics
7. **FR7**: The backend shall provide NXG points gamification APIs with achievement tracking, leaderboard management, and reward redemption functionality
8. **FR8**: The backend shall integrate with external 3D scanning service API, store avatar files in AWS S3, and provide body composition tracking endpoints
9. **FR9**: The backend shall implement push notification service with Firebase Cloud Messaging integration and personalized notification scheduling
10. **FR10**: The backend shall maintain WebSocket connections for real-time gym machine communication and workout data synchronization
11. **FR11**: The backend shall provide comprehensive user profile management APIs with body metrics tracking and demographic data management
12. **FR12**: The backend shall implement audit logging and error tracking with Sentry integration for all critical operations

## Non Functional

1. **NFR1**: The backend API shall handle 1000+ concurrent connections with response times under 200ms for critical endpoints using Redis caching and database optimization
2. **NFR2**: The backend shall maintain 99.9% uptime with automated health checks, graceful error handling, and circuit breaker patterns for external service calls
3. **NFR3**: The backend shall encrypt all data at rest using AES-256, implement TLS 1.3 for data in transit, and secure all API endpoints with proper authentication
4. **NFR4**: The backend shall implement comprehensive rate limiting (5 login attempts per 15 minutes), DDoS protection, and input validation using Joi/Zod schemas
5. **NFR5**: The backend API shall support horizontal scaling through stateless design, load balancer compatibility, and auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
6. **NFR6**: The backend shall implement GDPR-compliant data handling with user deletion capabilities, audit trails, and privacy controls for sensitive data
7. **NFR7**: The backend codebase shall maintain 80% minimum test coverage with Jest unit tests, Supertest integration tests, and automated security scanning
8. **NFR8**: The backend shall provide sub-second WebSocket message delivery for real-time machine status updates and workout data synchronization
9. **NFR9**: The backend shall implement structured logging with Winston, error tracking with Sentry, and comprehensive monitoring with health check endpoints
10. **NFR10**: The backend shall handle external service failures gracefully with cached fallbacks, retry logic, and proper error responses to client applications
