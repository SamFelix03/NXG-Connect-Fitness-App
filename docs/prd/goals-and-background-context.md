# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Build a robust, scalable Express.js/Node.js backend API that serves as the central data orchestrator for the NXG Connect Fitness ecosystem
- Implement comprehensive user authentication and session management with JWT-based security
- Create seamless integration layer with external AI services for workout planning, meal detection, and 3D avatar generation
- Develop real-time machine connectivity infrastructure supporting NFC/QR-based gym equipment integration
- Establish high-performance data management system using MongoDB and Redis for user profiles, workout tracking, and nutrition management
- Build scalable notification and analytics services supporting gamification and progress tracking features

## Background Context
The NXG Connect Fitness App requires a sophisticated backend API server that acts as the central nervous system for a modern fitness ecosystem. This backend will serve multiple client applications (mobile apps, web dashboards, gym equipment) while integrating with specialized external AI services for workout planning, nutrition analysis, and 3D body scanning.

The backend's primary responsibility is to orchestrate data flow between various services, maintain user state and progress tracking, handle real-time gym equipment communication, and provide a secure, high-performance API layer that enables rich fitness experiences without directly implementing AI algorithms.
