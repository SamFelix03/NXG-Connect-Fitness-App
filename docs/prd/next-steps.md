# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt
Based on this comprehensive backend PRD for the NXG Connect Fitness App, create a detailed system architecture that focuses on:

1. **API-First Design**: Design RESTful API architecture with clear endpoint organization, proper HTTP methods, and standardized response formats
2. **External Service Integration**: Architecture for seamless integration with workout planning, meal detection, nutrition planning, and 3D scanning services
3. **Real-time Infrastructure**: WebSocket architecture for machine connectivity, live workout tracking, and real-time notifications
4. **Data Architecture**: MongoDB schema design with Redis caching strategy for optimal performance with 1000+ concurrent users
5. **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security architecture including JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and data encryption
6. **Scalability Design**: Stateless API design supporting horizontal scaling, load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities
7. **Error Handling**: Circuit breaker patterns for external services, comprehensive error handling, and graceful degradation strategies
8. **Monitoring & Observability**: Logging architecture with Winston, error tracking with Sentry, and health monitoring systems

Focus on creating a production-ready backend architecture that can handle high-performance requirements while maintaining security, reliability, and maintainability for the complete fitness ecosystem.
