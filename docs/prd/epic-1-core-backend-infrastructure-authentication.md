# Epic 1: Core Backend Infrastructure & Authentication

**Epic Goal**: Establish a robust, secure Express.js backend foundation with comprehensive authentication, database connectivity, and core middleware that will support all subsequent API development.

## Story 1.1: Express.js Server Setup and Core Infrastructure

As a **backend developer**,
I want **a properly configured Express.js server with all essential middleware and database connections**,
so that **I have a solid foundation for building API endpoints with proper logging, security, and performance optimization**.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Express.js server configured with TypeScript, compression middleware, and CORS protection
2. MongoDB Atlas connection established with Mongoose ODM, connection pooling, and error handling
3. Redis connection configured with cluster support for session management and caching
4. Environment configuration management with dotenv and validation for all required variables
5. Health check endpoint (`/health`) returns detailed status of database, cache, and external service connections
6. Helmet.js security middleware configured with appropriate headers for API security
7. Morgan HTTP request logging integrated with Winston structured logging
8. Error handling middleware providing consistent error responses and Sentry integration

## Story 1.2: JWT Authentication System Implementation

As a **mobile app**,
I want **secure JWT-based authentication endpoints with refresh token support**,
so that **I can authenticate users safely and maintain secure sessions with automatic token renewal**.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. User registration endpoint (`POST /api/auth/register`) with email validation, password strength checking, and bcrypt hashing
2. Login endpoint (`POST /api/auth/login`) returning JWT access token (15-min expiry) and refresh token (7-day expiry)
3. Refresh token endpoint (`POST /api/auth/refresh`) validating refresh tokens and issuing new access tokens
4. Logout endpoint (`POST /api/auth/logout`) adding tokens to Redis blacklist for immediate invalidation
5. JWT middleware validating access tokens and extracting user context for protected routes
6. Rate limiting middleware preventing brute force attacks (5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP)
7. Password reset flow with secure token generation and email integration
8. Session management storing refresh tokens in Redis with automatic expiration cleanup

## Story 1.3: Input Validation and Security Middleware

As a **backend API**,
I want **comprehensive input validation and security protection**,
so that **I can prevent injection attacks, validate all incoming data, and maintain secure operation**.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Joi validation schemas implemented for all API endpoints with detailed error messages
2. Express-validator middleware for request sanitization and XSS prevention
3. MongoDB injection prevention through query sanitization and parameterized queries
4. CORS configuration allowing only authorized origins with proper preflight handling
5. Request size limiting middleware preventing oversized payload attacks
6. API versioning support with proper header handling and backward compatibility
7. Security headers middleware (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) configured via Helmet.js
8. Audit logging middleware tracking all authentication events and sensitive operations
