# Next Steps

After completing the architecture, proceed with implementation in this order:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Deploy AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation templates
2. **Core Backend Development**: Begin with Epic 1 (Core Infrastructure & Authentication)
3. **External Service Integration**: Implement integration layer for AI services
4. **Real-time Infrastructure**: Deploy WebSocket infrastructure for machine connectivity
5. **Testing & Validation**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy
6. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production with monitoring and observability

## Story Manager Handoff

The architecture is complete and ready for development. Key implementation priorities:

1. **Start with Core Infrastructure**: Epic 1 provides the foundation - implement Express.js setup, MongoDB/Redis connections, and JWT authentication first
2. **External Service Integration**: Implement circuit breaker patterns and caching for AI service integration from the beginning
3. **Real-time Requirements**: WebSocket infrastructure is critical for machine connectivity - prioritize this early in Epic 3
4. **Security First**: Implement all security middleware and validation from day one - security cannot be retrofitted
5. **Testing Strategy**: Set up testing infrastructure early - aim for 80% coverage from the start

## Developer Handoff

Architecture is production-ready for implementation. Key technical decisions validated:

1. **Direct HTTP Integration**: Simple, reliable approach for external AI services with proper error handling
2. **MongoDB + Redis**: Optimal for fitness data with real-time caching requirements
3. **Socket.IO WebSockets**: Proven solution for gym equipment real-time communication
4. **AWS Infrastructure**: Scalable, secure platform with comprehensive service ecosystem
5. **TypeScript + Express.js**: Mature, type-safe backend stack with excellent ecosystem support

The architecture supports 1000+ concurrent users, sub-200ms response times, and 99.9% uptime requirements through proven patterns and technologies.
